This project was created for the **ECSE Design Competition**.

## Prerequisites

**OpenCV** is required. Install it using `pip`:

```bash
python -m pip install opencv-python
```

NOTE: For Mac OS installing using pip can be weird. To install open cv I had to make a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install opencv-python
```

# How to run the app:

```bash
python main.py
```
